# ACCESSO

Asteroid Core Close Encounter Simulator and Synthetic Observations



This set of libraries and scripts allow for the simulation of asteroid-ateroid close encounters, and the generation of synthetic observation files of the trajectory of the perturbed asteroid.



Custom settings are available, and libraries to propagate asteroids and generate observations are better explained in read\_me.docx
